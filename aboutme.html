    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! Online I go by Blananas2 <span class="note">(he/him)</span> but you can call me Blan.<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Since I find bullet point lists of things unfathomably boring you're getting this instead. Most of what I do online revolves around gaming or computer science, sometimes both. I've been gaming since I was little (was a Nintendo kid, but PC gaming has since taken over for me!) and also became interested in computers around the same time, and started programming in high school. Very occasionally you'll see videos I've made on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Blananas2">YouTube</a> or streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blananas2">Twitch</a>. I'm more than happy to be the punching bag in any group I find myself in, takes a lot to make me upset.</p>
    <p>You most likely know me because of my work in the <i>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</i> <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/">modding community</a>. I first became aware of mods for the game in 2017 from Elias' excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ktaneteam6580/videos">module tutorial videos</a>.<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> The game has fascinated me ever since and it is undoubtedly my favorite game of all time. I've done quite a lot of things for the game, which include drawing and maintaining the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/iconsprite">icons</a> for the repository since 2018, writing manuals soon after joining the Discord, creating <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/blananas2/myworkshopfiles/?appid=341800">many modules</a> of my own since 2019, (mostly) experting for <a href="https://bombs.samfun.dev/user/Blan">many missions</a> and creating <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2281431586">my own missions</a> since 2020, and definitely more but I think you get the point. I don't plan on stopping any time soon and I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have about the game!</p>
    <p>If you asked me what the best game of all time is though, that'll have to go to </i><a href="https://www.celestegame.com/"><i>Celeste</i></a>. It's in my eyes a flawless game and I'm still playing it to this very day. I wouldn't consider myself amazing at it, my any% time is only a sub-47 (I don't take speedrunning that seriously... it is neat though!) and don't have all those golden strawberries at the time of writing. While I have played my fair share of <a href="https://gamebanana.com/games/6460">mods</a>, I doubt I'll get past Flag 2 in Spring Collab's Grandmaster Heart Side (turns out a tornado is pretty tough on the hands) and my limit is in the middle of Strawberry Jam's Grandmaster Lobby somewhere. Maybe I'll make something with Lönn at some point?</p>
    <p>This paragraph is mostly for miscellaneus information. Don't get me wrong, I love and am passionate about computer science, but that's really all you need to know about my relation aside from the modules I've made for Keep Talking, which I've already mentioned. I also have a special place in my heart for web games, especially those made in Flash, with my Flashpoint Finished list having around 400 games and counting. My other fascinations which I don't have a whole lot to talk about include cubing, art, Twitch and its culture, recreational mathematics, and queer culture. I do realize that despite what I said near the top about bullet point lists, my sentences can sound a whole lot like a bullet point list. Oh well. Below is all of the relevant links to my profiles on various sites, take care.</p>

    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn1">[1]</sup> I'll accept Blan, Blananas, or Blananas2. Please do <b>not</b> refer to me as "Blanana" (singular), I just think it sounds wrong. No worries if you've referred to me as such in the past, it's one of the consequences of having a username that's a bit of a tongue twister.</p>
    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn2">[2]</sup> Unfortunately the link I had to give here is because Elias needed to move all the videos over to another channel. There are extra videos that are not what I am referring to here, just sort videos by Oldest and those extras should sink down to the bottom.</p>
