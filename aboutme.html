    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! Online I go by Blananas2 <span class="note" title="Sidenote: I am a user of singular “they”, and will allow being referred to as “they”. Does that mean I should put “(he/they)” here? I'm honestly unsure, but “(he/him)” is my preference which is what these are for.">(he/him)</span> but you can call me Blan.<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Since I find bullet point lists of things unfathomably boring you're getting this instead. I've been gaming since I was little (was a Nintendo kid, but PC gaming has since taken over for me!) and also became interested in computers around the same time, and started programming in high school. Very occasionally you'll see videos I've made on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Blananas2">YouTube</a> or streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blananas2">Twitch</a>. I'm more than happy to be the punching bag in any group I find myself in, takes a lot to make me upset.</p>

    <p>You most likely know me because of my work in the <i>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</i> <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/">modding community</a>. I first became aware of mods for the game in 2017 from Elias' excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ktaneteam6580/search?query=KTANE%20-%20How%20To">module tutorial videos</a>. The game has fascinated me ever since and it is undoubtedly my favorite game of all time. I've done quite a lot of things for the game, which include drawing and maintaining the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/iconsprite">icons</a> for the repository since 2018, writing manuals soon after joining the Discord, creating <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/blananas2/myworkshopfiles/?appid=341800">many modules</a> of my own since 2019, (mostly) experting for <a href="https://bombs.samfun.dev/user/Blan">many missions</a> and creating <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2281431586">my own missions</a> since 2020, and definitely more but I think you get the point. I don't plan on stopping any time soon and I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have about the modded scene, or the game in general!</p>

    <p>If you asked me what the best game of all time is though, that'll have to go to </i><a href="https://www.celestegame.com/"><i>Celeste</i></a>. It's in my eyes a flawless game and I'm still playing it to this very day. I wouldn't consider myself amazing at it, my any% time is only a sub-47 (I don't take speedrunning that seriously... it is neat though!) though I did get <a href="https://youtu.be/a3rkTcpJVvs">202 berries</a> in 2026!<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> I've played quite a few <a href="https://gamebanana.com/games/6460">mods</a>, but don't have much modded Celeste street cred at the time of writing. I may also make stuff with Lönn at some point? Only time will tell.</p>
    
    <p>This paragraph is mostly for miscellaneus information. While am passionate about computer science, I've mostly utilized it for KTANE mods, though do let me know if you want my comically mediocre code elsewhere!<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> I also have a special place in my heart for web games, especially those made in Flash, having finished over 400 games and counting. My other fascinations which I don't have a whole lot to talk about include cubing, art, Twitch and its culture, recreational mathematics, speedrunning, and queer culture. I do realize that despite what I said near the top about bullet point lists, my sentences can sound a whole lot like a bullet point list. Oh well. Below is all of the relevant links to my profiles on various sites, take care.</p>

    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn1">[1]</sup> I'll accept Blan, Blananas, Blananas2, and possibly others. Please do <b>not</b> refer to me as "Blanana" (singular), I just think it sounds wrong. No worries if you've referred to me as such in the past, it's one of the consequences of having a username that's a bit of a tongue twister.</p>
    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn2">[2]</sup> Only care about Farewell Golden? See that standalone video <a href="https://youtu.be/Ear4_jhDjrc">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn3">[3]</sup> I know JavaScript the best, C# fairly well, and will tolerate HTML. I will cry if you ask me to do anything pertaining to CSS or C++ (before rejecting the offer, the former can burn in hell and I'd rather not go into my horror story regarding the latter).</p>
