    <h1>in which i yap about golden strats</h1>
    
    <p>this page is intended to go alongside by <a href="https://youtu.be/Ear4_jhDjrc">golden completion video</a>. i woulda embedded it here, if it worked...<sup class="fn" id="cr1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <p>before i say anything else though you definitely do not want to learn from me as i am far from the best celeste player, this page really is only so i can yap, not to be a guide you should follow; for that i would provide a whole list but also <a href="https://youtu.be/TSWYbn9ySb0">this guide by brackets</a> is incredibly well made (see a-01 for why i didn't use these strats everywhere)</p>
    <p>you can use ctrl+f to find internal room names (such as found in <a href="https://berrycamp.github.io/">berrycamp</a>), default cct names, and maybe the colloquial nickname if you're lucky, i'll also include <span class="red">timestamps</span> so you can look at the video and provide illustrations where helpful. also no i don't so into every room, some rooms just don't have a lot going on</p>

          i never bothered to learn the speed strat here. one quote which i attribute to Hank Green is to be truly productive, put in 80% of effort <i>but no further</i>, not to say i didn't incorporate strats, this page wouldn't exist otherwise, but speed was not an important factor for me

          so from the previous room, i think a hyper giving speed into double-dash crystal is the best way to go about the start of this room. with the rest, you're on your own.

          a note regarding my controls: my LB and RB (bumper) buttons are <i>instant hyper</i> buttons, meaning they input down + corresponding horizontal direction (LB for left, RB for right) + jump + dash; i learned that pressing A + X + down-diag analog is very inconsistent for me<sup class="fn" id="cr2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>

          obligatory another cornerboost success which woulda killed me if i let it continue w/o a down dash, and hold jump and get the boost from the fish once again

          though i'll also note, there is a save if you don't get the top coin!
          <img src="img/fwy/b02.png"><br>
          grab onto the token block (duh), <i>wait until the fish is approaching the right half of their wiggle</i>, do a strictly vertical jump so that your next jump can be as high up as possible before jumping, then holding left into the fish, hopefully causing it to explode back to safety

          isn't it strange that two consecutive demos have the normal (crouched) demo animation first, but then a normal animation second? i wanna know what's up with that, feel free to get in touch

          the fumble at the start with the jelly has never happened before. the part i struggle with the most in this room is lining up the up dash through the spinners to get to the power box, though i guess i coulda labbed that out. i'm also very glad i didn't mess the rest of it up as it coulda gone a <i>lot</i> messier

          somehow someway i don't remember the reverse super ever failing me in a run (it was to line up the fish up dash). only other thing worth remembering (heh) is to dash high up on the second fish because gravity exists

          demo spinner gap, and go over the spinners with a jellyvator to make it over to spring and then updashing out. <span>you can smuggle the jelly into next room but i'm gonna be real the idea of being this safe only to still screw up the next room is an idea so revolting to me i refuse to do it even though it's objectively the better strat</span>

          ok if there's any strat you should steal from me let it be this: a right dash into the first spring makes everything after it so much more reliable it's actually insane. the diagonals may look scary, and the inputs aren't any easier, heck this may even be some placebo but it's a <i>functional</i> placebo. note that also the up then up-right into the third spring are done in very quick succession. as for final block i hope you know how to optimal climb jump<sup class="fn" id="cr3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>, sorry i can't help any more on that front!

          another strat courtesy of brackets: dashing into wall (being cognizant of movement stick as to not fall, that one hurt about as much as the mistake above), wait for swap block to come back, then jump and buffer dash input so that you don't need to guess when to dash to move the fish over correctly. being too early bit me a few times too many before i implemented this

          i got into the habit of holding jump at the start of this room idunno why it just feels nicer to my hands, keep in mind the puffer explosion is nuanced: you <u>do not</u> want the boost so hold left into it, however once it has exploded <u>you do want to hold right</u> or you won't make it. i also wouldn't recommend demoing at the end. don't ask me why

          <img src="img/fwy/e08.png"><br>
          drop 1 is lined up using the fizzler, drop 2 is lined up using the background tiles, and for the jelly grab you want to stay on the lower portion (as shown in video is overkill, you do not need to be that low), and just before the block disappears you climb jump (collecting the crystal), dash up-right to grab the jelly as you move down, then the rest is cake. bonus points if you can get the fake heart like me with a bunnyhop (:

          Okay, I'm gonna "break character" for a moment because I consider this important. <b>Do not beat yourself up if you die in the tech tutorial rooms.

          <img src="img/fwy/f00.png"><br>
          anyway what i do for ^this wall bounce is to wait until the moon block is where it's shown above or lower (using the border of the ghost Maddy screen as a visual cue) before dropping down into spring and using the lower moon block for easier line up

          i cut it a <i>little</i> too close with where i decided to stay on the Kevin. get very used to the climb jump hold left then climb jump hold right. basically all the movement in this room minimizes Kevin dust bunnies until they're necessary. landing on the left is preferable for easy finish

          this is my favorite strat in the entire map, credits to Parrot and Clantis: in the previous room i bunnyhop so that i collect the double-dash from the right-hand side before landing back on the ground. after climbing back up, take a good look at the controller as the double-dash returns: right dash, dash, buffer left movement using the crystal freeze frames. if done correctly you'll be in the perfect spot to make it under the spinner in the way. do note you still need to be careful to not fuck up the rest of the room, it's not free

          please use demos in this room!! it makes it so much easier!! oh yea and you can also just go as far up the first dream block as possible that also helps. tiny shoutouts to the wall jumps i do at the start, they make me happy :3

          i wavedash (from a little far back, see video) when the block is around here on the right-hand side, <i>earlier is fine, but later is not fine</i>. remember in the middle after going through this gap that you can move up on the block to make the hop easier. for final wall bounce i find it best to compare relative to Madeline, once the spikes on the block line up with her head you hold right until you fall then you go left to hit the spring and it should be well lined-up wall bounce.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
          i <s>almost certainly</s> do this suboptimally, the start third is prone to error as i kinda just wing the starting placement and i've heard the preferred strat is an extended hyper for some reason, ditto for the final third because of the right->left->spring. basically don't listen to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/TSWYbn9ySb0">listen to brackets</a> instead

        <ul><li>
          another brackets strat i stole after more deaths than necessary: on the highest pixel of the wall (if Maddy does a bit of movement back down, you're in the right spot; this is infinitely retryable as the video demonstrates), then <b><i>NOT&nbsp;USING&nbsp;ANALOG</i></b> hold down-right dash on as close to the same frame as you can. if done correctly you make it past the right-hand side in quite possibly the strat with the highest actual safety to how safe it looks ratio possible

          two minor things: 1) if you're on analog i do recommend what i do for the dropper segment which is to bind right analog stick down to downward movement for the fastfall and 2) if you are the type to want to hang out in discord vc but also want to lock in on the latter half of the run, the end of this room is not a bad spot to do it (or, if you're not yet consistent at EH, or it gives you nerves still, do it after finishing the bs tutorial rooms)
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
          two minorer things: -1) that feather was like prolly frames away from a spinner. -2) the up-right into last feather is probably not necessary but i don't think it can actively kill ya either

          one thing i'm kinda obligated to mention there's so many routes that honestly this is one you should lab yourself, that said...<br>
          <img src="img/fwy/h06b_2.png"><br>
          my first jump is when this ice ball is at its highest, as shown.<br>
          as a general rule of thumb, on top of demoing where it makes sense, if you're <u>inside</u> a ring of ice balls, <u>do not</u> hold jump; likewise if you're <u>inside</u> a ring of ice balls, <u>holding jump can be safe</u>. and on the topic of nerves, this next room is fucking <b>tough</b>, so take a swig of water like i did if you think you need it, seriously

          from the right-hand side of this block, hold down right (using d-pad for analog players), extended hyper (i.e. jump late), up-right demo into spring 1 (d-pad optional, but recommended), another up-right demo, DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;HOLD&nbsp;RIGHT (the wind will line you up), then up demo<sup class="fn" id="cr6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>. remember that it's optimal to climb up on the final blocks before jumping

          for <u>core elevators</u>, hold jump as <u>high up</u> as possible, the red dots are a good visual cue. for the <u>ice walls</u>, start your dash as <u>low</u> as possible (while still being near the wall), the tokens are <b>not</b> low enough. also, don't go up after this room, makes the ending harder.

          i like to bop the right-hand side of kevin, keeping the kevin as leftmost as is reasonable on the down dash. the double-dash grab you see in the video <b>is optional</b>, even if you're too low you'll still be able to dash upwards at the end as shown in the video

          ok this might be the dumbest strat i do: i cornerboost from the previous room and then kinda just.. wing it, like there's not <i>0</i> rhyme or reason to my movement, but it's hard to articulate so the best i can really do is just tell ya to watch the video it's just something i got very very used to (or just lab it yourself)

          extended hyper audio cue, sort of: the cassette blocks go "dun, dun-dun (pause)" and i dash on the pause. the rhythm of the blocks is fortunately easy for me to keep up with. after the first blue and grabbing the double-dash crystal, your dashes should be as high up as possible (close to the lightning, without dashing into it). this ensures you can grab the bottom of the pink, though make sure you climb jump quickly. also make sure you time the exit of the pink box well, you don't wanna die to those spikes in there

          immediate super on entry gets you in between the blues, and the pattern i follow is up-right -> grab crystal -> fall a bit -> dash up -> hold right grabbing the wall -> jump -> repeat. at the end (on next blues), you can climb up and over as the yellow can't really kill you

          be very careful with the "slalom" drop in-between the visible fish ranges. for the second pufferfish, you want to hold <i>left</i> to <b>not</b> get the boost, but once it explodes, <i>switch to right</i> and just time the dash well after that. definitely also worth having the dodge of the jutty-out-bit-of-electricity in your muscle memory. don't miss the double-dash soon after, yes that is possible to miss. don't fuck up the "puzzle" at the end either

          going into the corner for the extended hyper probably isn't <i>necessary</i> normalization but i found it helpful especially if i timed my jump from hyper hella late. for jelly release, you wanna be a little to the right (not immediately above) the double-dash so that once you release and move back slightly you are aligned with the double-dash. take the moon blocks safe, that would be a sad death

          get very used to the sequence: dash left -> hop on Kevin -> jump -> dash up-right. if you fail it, the Kevin <b>does not</b> come back. you can hold down-right for the rest of the room for the wavedashes. and as for nerve management, what i did was undeafen myself in the discord vc, Deaf (the other person in vc) never ended up speaking in fwfw but he was there if i wanted to say some dumb shit that he wanted to respond to. don't forget that whatever happens in the farewell checkpoint, be proud of yourself!

          waiting around ^here (marked with ω) so the electricity is as shown in green is so much safer than the alternative.<br>
          notice my input display just before the onslaught of fish: intended wants me to hold for a long time, which is tough on the finger, so what i do here is hold both LT and RT (both are bound to grab), then release LT to give that finger some rest, then go back to LT and RT, then back to the normal LT before moving through the fish. that little adjustment is all i need for the finger to survive the rest of the room.<br>
          <img style="width:500px; height:500px;" src="img/fwy/j16_3.png"><br>
          ^here, take note of a couple things: 1) line this fish up properly, fortunately the wind makes this easier than normal, 2) you notice i do not use a strictly horizontal feather angle to make this a bit tighter, because you don't want to be so far away from the falling block that you literally do not make it there; being high up on the lower portion as shown is preferable for the same reason<br>
          <img style="width:375px; height:375px;" src="img/fwy/j16_4.png"><br>
          don't demo ^this, that can backfire.<br>
          for final section, the pufferfish can give you so much speed that holding right can just send you too far forward, look at input display for when i back off. and at the end, because it's my favorite line in the game, "Say goodbye to her for me."<sup class="fn" id="cr8-1"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>

          i prefer top route for grabbing jelly. i ensure for both ice walls i'm not too close for bouncing the jelly off of (if you lose the jelly, it can go awry fast), i make my way up as shown, and for up dash through spinners i was thinking that if i was not lined up properly not to hold grab, but i nailed the line-up first try. smooth sailing from there, enjoy the moment of victory as there's really no other feeling like it

          <li>i also made a (not public) wheel filled with tier 1 silvers. at the time of writing, i've done and not recorded 69 of them, i'll likely redo them for goldberries</li>
          <li>but also also i am not forcing myself to do specific maps if i don't enjoy them, nor will i force myself only into deathless, i can totally see myself just having a chill time with casual stuff</li>
          <li>not even strictly gameplay related but i wanna be a little more out there and celeste spaces are fairly chill so if you see me just know that max% was definitely the catalyst</li>

    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn9">[9] <a href="#cr9">^</a></sup> if you, like me, wanna practice this room at the end of low deaths: use Everest, turn debug mode on, press F6 (menu) then F2 (center cam on current room), use camera (middle mouse) to move mostly right and a little down (see berrycamp if you struggle, they're correctly positioned relative to each other there; you can press F2 again if you're lost), and right click in the golden room to enter it</p>
    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn10">[10] <a href="#cr10">^</a></sup> for continuing a low death from a golden attempt, you will need to die (i recommend using retry) in the first room once you debug back there without the golden, as it won't count your golden death</p>

    <p class="note"><sup class="fnfn" id="fn12">[12] <a href="#cr12">^</a></sup> i should note for fw specifically your pb as shown by this mod is <i>not</i> reliable, the journal (what death tracker displays) only counts lowest death count from the <b>start</b> checkpoint, not <b>singular</b>. my pb at the start of the video was actually 1, not 2. so unless you wanna play from start every time you'll need to keep track of low death pb yourself</p>
