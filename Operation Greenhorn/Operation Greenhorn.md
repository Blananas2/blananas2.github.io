# Operation Greenhorn
Merged manual for the Operation Greenhorn mission pack by ItzShaun.

Blan wants to mention there's some _very_ jank stuff in here which I apologize for. I would not recommend following in my footsteps for future merged manuals.
I know about these issues but ultimately I have no idea what I'm doing nor do I know how to fix them. In the future building a system from the ground up is what I'll do as I do want to make a merged manual with higher scope at a later date.
